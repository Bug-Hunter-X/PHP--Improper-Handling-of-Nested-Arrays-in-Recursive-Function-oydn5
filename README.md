This repository contains a PHP example demonstrating an uncommon error related to handling nested arrays within recursive functions.  The `bug.php` file showcases the faulty code, while `bugSolution.php` presents the corrected version. The bug arises from insufficient type checking and error handling during the recursive traversal of nested arrays.  The solution improves the robustness by adding validation before array manipulation.
